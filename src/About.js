        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p>The <b>O-PIN AG</b> project brings together partners from industries, government, and academia to develop an open sourced curriculum based on vertical farming and building a food computer. As an open sourced project, we heavily rely on our community to co-create the next generation of high-tech farmers. 
          O-PIN AG is a part of a nonprofit organization called <b>Project Innovate Newark (P.I.N.)</b>. PIN's mission is to work with Newark's multisector community by developing and innovative and quantitative strategies that build upon existing assets within the city.  
        </p>
        <p>This project is based off a piece of <b>MIT's Open Agriculture Research Inititiave</b>. They have open sourced a guide to build your own Personal Food Computer including activity guides, materials lists, and helpful tips on how to get parts manufactured. Our goal is to modernize science education by using MIT's affordable Food Computer to build a curriculum based around it and open source this curriculum for educators city wide. This curriculum will begin with principles of agriculture, continue into basic plant science, and culminate to building a food computer utilizing the open sourced MIT curriculum. Our team would like to satisfy state requirements for the curriculum to expand into Newark Public Schools. </p><br></br>
